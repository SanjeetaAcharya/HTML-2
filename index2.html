      in preventing the British empire from colonizing Nepal. Though Nepal is a
      multi-lingual, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious country,
      there has not been any conflict between any group in the name of the
      language, religion, or ethnicity. the unity among diversity that is
      prevalent in Nepal proves that Nepalese are cooperative and peace-loving.
      It also inspires other nations to follow its people's harmonious unity.
      Nepalese people respect guests as their gods since there is a popular
      belief that "Atithi Debo Bhawa". It is a strong example to prove that
      Nepalese are spiritually rich through they are economically poor. Nepalese
      people love freedom and democracy. That is why they have fought several
      times for democracy through their leaders deceive them time and again.
      Recently, Nepal has been declared a republic country and promulgated a new
      constituent.
